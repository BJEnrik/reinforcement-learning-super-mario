    "Gaming has always been an integral part of my life, providing entertainment, escapism, and even valuable life lessons. The impact of gaming on my personal growth and development cannot be understated. From the humble beginnings of classic 8-bit NES games, where I first discovered the joy of gaming, to the immersive world of Pokémon on the portable Game Boy, and the revolutionary leap into the console era with the iconic PlayStation 2, each era has left an indelible mark on my gaming journey. I spent countless hours immersed in the vast virtual landscapes of browser-based MMORPGs like RuneScape, forging friendships and memories that still resonate with me today. And then there was Dota 2, the pinnacle of competitive gaming that captivated me with its strategic depth and electrifying gameplay."

    "There have been several mentions of reinforcement learning already, but what exactly is it? Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning that involves training an agent to make sequential decisions based on trial and error. In simple terms, it's like teaching a computer program to learn from its own experiences and interactions with the environment, just like how we learn from rewards and consequences in our daily lives. [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine training an AI to play a game of Super Mario. The AI starts off knowing nothing about the game, but through trial and error, it learns which actions lead to rewards (collecting coins, avoiding enemies) and which actions lead to negative outcomes (losing lives, falling into pits). Over time, the AI becomes better at playing the game by maximizing its rewards and minimizing its mistakes."

The learning rate of 1e-5 was deemed too high, impacting the agent's performance. Lower learning rates, such as 1e-6 or 1e-7, yielded better results. For instance, when trained with a learning rate of 1e-6, the supermario agent managed to clear world 1-1 within just 4 million timesteps. The expectation of achieving the same result with a learning rate of 1e-5 proved unsuccessful.\n",

By incorporating automatic model saving, increasing training steps, customizing reward systems, adjusting learning rates and step sizes, and more, we can create more sophisticated and specialized AI agents.\n",

The realm of AI offers boundless opportunities for exploration and exploitation."
